# Wenomechainsama, but it's a .vbs file.
I made a little vbs front-end inspired by TikTok Memes.


# Before you run this .vbs file
Windows Media Player recommended before running this script!
Add the .vbs file into desktop by right clicking "Wenomechainsama.vbs", then go to "Send to", then click "Desktop (create shortcut)".
